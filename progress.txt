[2026-02-09 10:10 PST] PROJECT START
Lead: 0xClaw
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project initialized using the orchestrator skill (dogfooding our own system).

Context: Deadly wanted a central hub to manage all projects, see what's happening
across everything, and eventually support department agents. We designed the 
orchestrator skill first (SKILL.md + 7 archetypes + dashboard + migration guide),
then used it to plan this project.

PRD created by prd-worker (Opus). 13 features, API server design, migration plan.
TASKS.md created by task-worker (Opus). 42 tasks across 4 phases.
state.json created by dashboard-worker (Sonnet). Mechanical transformation.

Phase 1: Foundation (API server + Overview tab)
Phase 2: Project Migration (3 active projects + register all)
Phase 3: Full Dashboard (all tabs functional)
Phase 4: Polish & Ship (responsive, errors, mobile)

Dashboard: http://0xs-mac-mini.tailacc337.ts.net:3400/ (after Phase 1)

[2026-02-09 12:00 PST] A-005, A-006: HTML Shell + Design System
Lead: code-worker (Opus)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Built index.html — the Command Center dashboard shell.

A-005 (Tab Navigation & Routing):
- Single index.html file at project root with inline CSS and JS
- 6 tabs: Overview, Projects, Content, Research, Ideas, Agents
- Hash routing: #/overview, #/projects, #/content, #/research, #/ideas, #/agents
- No hash or empty hash defaults to #/overview via location.replace (no extra history)
- Invalid hash (e.g. #/garbage) redirects to #/overview
- Browser back/forward works via hashchange listener
- Pasting URL with hash loads correct tab
- Vanilla JS only, no frameworks, IIFE-wrapped

A-006 (Design System & Dark Theme):
- All 11 CSS custom properties defined in :root
- No hardcoded color values outside :root block
- Font stack: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif
- Monospace: 'SF Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace (used for agent IDs, clock)
- Status dot classes: in_progress=blue, done=green, testing=yellow,
  failed=red, blocked=purple, todo=gray (text-dim)
- GitHub-dark aesthetic throughout

Tab placeholder content:
- Overview: "Loading overview data..." with icon
- Projects: "Select a project" with icon
- Content: "Loading content tasks..." with icon
- Research: "Loading research tasks..." with icon
- Ideas: "Loading ideas..." with icon
- Agents: 0xClaw lead orchestrator card (green dot, always active) +
  4 department agent placeholders (Engineering, Content, Research, QA)
  with "Coming Soon" badge

Clock in top-right shows current date/time, updates every second.
